# Script Auto-Sync:

Cheat Engine's built-in script editor is extremely basic and lacks many features such as autocomplete, extensive code-highlighting, and search-and-replace.
To circumvent this, this autorun script allows you to use any editor of your choice.
It does this by automatically syncing any file on your PC to the CE record list (where scripts are stored and executed from).
This script also defines a basic GUI that allows you to see all scripts that are currently being synced in the table, as well as delete them through the context menu.
