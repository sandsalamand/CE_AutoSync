# Script Auto-Sync

## The problem:
Cheat Engine's built-in script editor is extremely basic and lacks many features such as autocomplete, extensive code-highlighting, and search-and-replace.

## The solution:
This utility allows you to use the editor of your choice by automatically syncing any file on your PC to the Cheat Engine record list (where scripts are stored and executed from).
A basic GUI allows you to see all scripts that are currently being synced in the table, as well as delete them through the context menu.

Checkmarks are added to records to identify synchronized files.
